# Breakfast, Lunch, or Dinner? (Part 3)

# What will the following code print? Why? Don't run it until you've attempted to answer. 

def meal
	return 'Breakfast'
	'Dinner'
end

puts meal

# This will print `Breakfast` because `return` instructs the method to stop the execution flow and immediately return the given string.
