# Breakfast, Lunch, or Dinner? (Part 6)

# What will the following code print? Why? Don't run it until you've attempted to answer. 

def meal
	return 'Breakfast'
	'Dinner'
	puts 'Dinner'
end

puts meal

# This will print `Breakfast` and return it because `return` is the first line in the method, and it immediately exits from there.
