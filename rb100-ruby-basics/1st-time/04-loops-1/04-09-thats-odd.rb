# That's Odd

# The code below shows an example of a `for` loop. Modify the code so that it only outputs `i` if `i` is an odd number.

for i in 1..100
	puts i if i.odd?
end

# I think this was my first time matching the given solution! At first I wrote the nested if loop in 3 lines, but then I remembered you can write it much more concisely if it's a 1 liner.
