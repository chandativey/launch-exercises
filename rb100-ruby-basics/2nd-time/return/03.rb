# Breakfast, Lunch, or Dinner? (Part 3)

# What will the following code print? Why? Don't run it until you've attempted to answer.

def meal
  return 'Breakfast'
  'Dinner'
end

puts meal

# This prints 'Breakfast' and returns `nil`. Since we have an explicit return statement this time, 'Breakfast' is explicitly returned and the method is immediately exited.
