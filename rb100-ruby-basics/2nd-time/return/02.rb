# Breakfast, Lunch, or Dinner? (Part 2)

# What will the following code print? Why? Don't run it until you've attempted to answer.

def meal
  'Evening'
end

puts meal

# Like last time, this prints 'Evening' and returns `nil`. Every method returns the last evaluated expression in it, which is 'Evening' here, regardless of whether or not there's an explicit return.
