# Digit Product

# Given a String of digits, our digit_product method should return the product of all digits in the String argument. You've been asked to implement this method without using reduce or inject.

# When testing the method, you are surprised by a return value of 0. What's wrong with this code and how can you fix it?

def digit_product(str_num)
  digits = str_num.chars.map { |n| n.to_i }
  product = 1

  digits.each do |digit|
    product *= digit
  end

  product
end

p digit_product('12345')

# Product being assigned to 0 means that anything multiplied by it is 0, which is why we get 0 as result. We can change product to equal 1 and we get the expected result.
